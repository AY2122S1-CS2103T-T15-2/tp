### Project: Ailurus

Ailurus helps to organize committee accounts for details of their members. It provides users with convenient viewing 
and editing access to all information, thus providing much convenience in their work. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

#### New Features
1. Adding in display windows for Task and Event List.
2. Adding in title labels for each list in GUI.
