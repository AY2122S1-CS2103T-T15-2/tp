### Project: Ailurus

Ailurus helps organizing committees account for details of their members. 
It provides users with convenient viewing and editing access to all information, thus providing much convenience in their work.
The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Implemented event.
    * What it does: Event contains members, name, date and allows us to mark and store the attendance of members. It can be saved and stored in json like member.
    * Justification: This feature improves the product by allowing users to plan and organize events for their members.
    * Highlights: This enhancement affects how the GUI will be presented, and we now have to accommodate the presence of events in the model, storage and future commands. It required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives such as whether to have members have events as a field or events to have a set of members.
    * Credits: *{mention here if you reused any code/ideas from elsewhere or if a third-party library is heavily used in the feature so that a reader can make a more accurate judgement of how much effort went into the feature}*


* **New Feature**: Implemented filter attributes to list for task and member.
  * What it does: Members can be listed by event and attendance as filters. Task list for a member can be filtered by status or if overdue.
  * Justification: This feature improves the product by making it easier to search and view tasks or members through filters. It aids with administrative matters.
  * Highlights: The enhancement affects the lists displayed in the GUI, only showing the matches. Commands will be required for which to show the full unfiltered list again.
