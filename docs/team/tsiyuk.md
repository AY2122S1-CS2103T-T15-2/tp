### Project: Ailurus

Ailurus helps organizing committees account for details of their members. 
It provides users with convenient viewing and editing access to all information, thus providing much convenience in their work.
The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Implemented Task and TaskList
  * What is does: Task contains name, deadline and allows users to mark and store the completion status of that task.
    And each member has a task list that contains all the task of the member. The task list can be saved and stored in json array as an attribute of member.
  * Justification: This feature enhances our product by allowing users to keep track of the tasks assigned to each member.
  * Highlights: This enhancement affects the model, storage and future commands. It required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives such as whether to have a global task list or each member has its task list.

* **New Feature**: Implemented task editing commands.
  * What is does: tedit command can edit the name and deadline of the task, tdone command can mark a task as done, tundone command can mark a task as uncompleted.
  * Justification: This feature imporves the product by allowing users to edit the detail information of an existing task.
