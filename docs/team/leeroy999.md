### Project: Ailurus

Ailurus helps organizing committees account for details of their members. 
It provides users with convenient viewing and editing access to all information, thus providing much convenience in their work.
The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added CRUD operations for events using appropriate commands, and finding of event by name
    * What it does: allows users to add, delete, edit and list events that are registered in Ailurus, and search for a specific event name.
    * Justification: This features allows users to group members in events with date included, to keep track of who are supposed to attend specific events and subsequently mark their attendance if necessary. This is useful for small and large scale events and possibly meetings and conferences as well in a work setting, and allow easier organisation.

* **New Feature**: Added marking and unmarking of attendance for members in an event.

* **New Feature**: Added commands to add and delete individual members from an event.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to list out all members in an event.
  * Justification: This feature allows users to check the list of members in an event so that deletion and marking of attendance for members in the event is possible using the appropriate commands, excluding those not in the event to prevent error in selecting wrong members to mark or delete.
